# random-password-generator

This assignment had us create a random password generator from scratch. Initially, I had a whole different way of approaching this assignment. 
after three days of banging my head on the table I realized that I needed to scrap the code and start fresh. I reached out to my fellow cohorts and they were a big help. Erik in particular really helped me understand where my issues were and recommended I get some sessions with the tutors. 

so what you see now is my finished code.

Random Password Generator

1. The user visits the site and upon clicking on the "Generate Password" button they get a prompt asking them for the length of their password.
If the user attempts a password under or ove the required characters of 8-128 the page reloads.

2. After they complete the prompts the site goes through an array of letters, numbers, and symbols to spit out a random password. 

3. Understanding the indexing of the randomizer and the prompts was key to understanding how this page was going to work.

4. This was a very tough assignment. I feel like now that i understand what its doing it makes me feel more comfortable with generating this.
